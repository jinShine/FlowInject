## ðŸš¢ Usage

### Using FlowInject from App Launch
To use Navigator from the launch of the app, make sure to create the appâ€™s window programmatically in `AppDelegate.swift`
Then, set the Navigator as the root of the windowâ€™s view hierarchy in the `AppDelegate.didFinishLaunching`.
```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?


    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
      
      self.window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
      let appNavigator = AppNavigator(in: self.window)

        return true
    }

}
```
